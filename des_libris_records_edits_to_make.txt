This is a MARC text file. These records have been exported from the Voyager catalogue because the URLs are no longer correct. The URL is in the 856 MARC field.

Edit the URL in the 856 field. 

Instead of the base URL being: 

http://site.ebrary.com/lib/uvic/Doc?id=

The URL base should be:
http://deslibris.ca/ID/

What comes after "/ID/" will depend on each record.

1. It may come at the end of a "celarc" URL in a 530 field: 
i.e. =530  \\$aAlso available in PDF form for download:$uhttp://celarc.ca/cppc/240/240827.pdf

this needs to replace the current 856 field so it looks like this:

=856  40$uhttp://deslibris.ca/ID/240827


2. It may come at the end of a "deslibris" URL in a 530 field:
i.e. =530  \\$aT{acute}el{acute}echargement disponible en PDF:$uhttp://deslibris.ca/Info/247565


this needs to replace the current 856 field so it looks like this:
=856  40$uhttp://deslibris.ca/ID/247565

3. Delete the 530 field with either the celarc URL or the deslibris URL

4. Some records will have neither of these 530 fields so the new URL can't be constructed. Those can remain unchanged.
