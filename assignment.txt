Create a script called modify_dates.py.

In the script:

    Read in the csv file: victorian_serial_novels_unedited.csv

    Convert the dates to Extended Date Time Format (edtf) using regular expressions.
     - Dates of the form YYYY-YYYY should become YYYY/YYYY
     - Dates of the form MM/DD/YYYY should become YYYY-MM-DD
     
    Output the modified file to victorian_serial_novels_unedited.csv
